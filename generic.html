										<h1>About Me</h1>

									<p><h3>“Somewhere something incredible is waiting to be known.”</h3>- Carl Sagan</p> 
									<p>I believe, this has been the driving force behind all my decision-making till today. As a child, I used to observe things and draw them on paper. I always had a curiosity of exploring things, knowing what is inside, how do they work. As I grew up, I had a proclivity towards taking up tasks and projects that allowed more creative thinking and seemed more challenging. Getting exposed to Design was an essential paradigm shift for me as a student and a professional.</p>

									<h2>Knowledge Enhancement with COPODS</h2><h5>From Feb 2018</h5>
									<p>COPODS as startup has provided me a platform to strengthen and improve my Design Strategy, Client Handeling along with other design skills. Additionally I’m continuously learning Business and Development aspects along with design. Getting complete ownership of multiple Projects from start to end is plus point.</p><hr class="major" />

									<h2>Industry Experience with GLOBANT</h2><h5>July 2015 - Feb 2018</h5>
									<p>Working with Globant (earlier ‘Clarice Technologies’, considered to be one of the best Design firms in India for a Design fresher) from past 2+ years, made me a fervent and accomplished User Experience Designer, with an impressive array of clients such as Google, EXL and AppOrbit under my belt. Working in Enterprise and Consumer User Experience domain, I have learnt and created my own niche in the ever-challenging world of Design.</p>

									<h2>Practice at TIMBR</h2> <h5>May 2014 - June 2014</h5>
									<p>The first practical industry experience includes working with young entrepreneurs and assisting young start-ups such as TIMBR (a Startup in SINE, IIT Bombay) to blend design thinking in their business strategy and product road-mapping. A short stint but a confidence booster and eye opener at the same time. The industry experience provided exposure and confidence over the possibility of my design being literally developed with tech integration and experienced by the end users.  </p>

									<h2>Learning at IDC IIT Bombay</h2><h5>July 2013 - July 2015</h5>
									<p>Getting into IIT and exposure to things I always wanted to learn and explore, was a dream come true. An incessant access to diverse interdepartmental information in the campus, constantly changed my benchmarks to set my goals towards learning Design integration in different areas of the society. I like to be a student to learn, give and take always. It has changed my perspective towards looking at things around me like Sherlock Holmes  or Gregory House of Interaction Design. </p>

									<h2>Opening at KAMPA ENTERPRISES</h2><h5>December 2011 - June 2013</h5>
									<p>Instead of going for big IT firms after graduation, I chose to join a startup, as a project engineer, where I had all the liberties to perform, learn and enhance my skills at each level of the projects. Cons of not having a great salary, but had many learnings and takeaways in doing challenging projects with different kinds of people, managing them, working with deadlines, working in a team for bigger projects. Having worked from start to end in a project, I became more adaptable to most kind of work environments. During this course of time, I got introduced to Design, Its scope and value in industry.</p>
